<h1 class="text-2xl text-violet-400"> GAMEPLAN </h1>

The main focus of this deck is to use the commander, Gyruda, Doom of Depths ETB ability to mill out your opponents and simultaneously play creatures for free, and then to do it again and again with the many clone creatures.

<br/>
This is a flexible deck that can be played either fast or slow and controlling, and can be played to a couple different win conditions. 
<br/>

<h2 class="mt-2 text-xl text-purple-400"> General Notes </h2>
<p>
    Can prepare ahead of time with the handful of top-deck manipulators like Scrollrack or with top-deck tutors like Vampiric Tutor.
</p>
<p class="mt-1">
    Legend rule only lets you keep one Gyruda after cloned as a state based action (SBA).
    <br/>
    Once the SBA is resolved, by sacrificing one of your two Gyrudas, Gyruda's ETB effect will go on the stack REGARDLESS OF WHICH ONE YOU SACRIFICED. You can continue the clone chain from here if your top decks are lucky enough!
</p>
<p class="mt-1">
    There are so many good even CMC creatures that aren’t in your deck, or even in your colors, that will be available to you if you play this deck. If you mill your opponent's stuff that might be more useful, then take their creature!

        Endless Mill with Mortuary
        <br/>
    Mortuary is an old card from Stronghold that allows for infinite mill schenanigans when setup properly. Mortuary, when paired with Gyruda and any non-special clone will allow you to infinitely replay the same clone over and over, milling out everyone's graveyards. This is all possible because of the legendary rule and its SBA that requires you to sacrifice one of your two identical legendary creatures.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <h2>A quick example of the of Mortuary Combo: </h2>
    <ul class="px-4 list-disc">
        <li> Have Mortuary and Gyruda, Doom of Depths on the board, with Clone (or any similar clone spell) in your hand. </li>
        <li> Cast Clone. </li>
        <li> Clone enters the battlefield as a copy Gyruda. SBA (Legend Rule) forces you to sacrifce one of your Gyrudas.</li>
        <li> With the SBA resolved, two triggers are placed onto the stack. A Mortuary trigger and Gyruda trigger. (C.R. 603.3b) </li>
        <li> Make sure that the Mortuary trigger resolves first and that the Gyruda trigger resolves second.
        <br/>
        Because the Mortuary resolved first you place the recently sacrificed Clone onto the top of your library.</li>
        <li> Gyruda trigger now resolves and you play the Clone that you just milled.</li>
        <li>SBA action goes onto the stack and you infinitely repeat this process over until everyone has milled out their library.</li>
        <li> To end this loop, simply clone another creature that isn't Gyruda or another legendary you control. </li>
    </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div id="Tidespout" class="tabcontent hidden border border-solid border-stone-600 p-4">
    <h1 class="text-2xl text-purple-400 mb-2"> Tidespout </h1>
    <div>
        To create infinite mana with Tidespout on the board, we need at least 1 mana positive producer (Grim Monolith or Sol Ring) and 1 mana neutral producer (even if it produces no mana - as long as it costs 0 to cast, like Mox Opal or Lotus Petal). We can have both rocks in hand or one in hand and one on the board, but we need to have something to cast to start our infinite mana engine.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Tidespout triggers on cast, so make sure to tap and float your mana in response to the bounce trigger.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        You can then funnel your infinite mana, to bounce and then replay your commander or clone you control as many times as you want. Hopefully you win with that.
        <br/>
        Since Tidespout Tyrant triggers on cast you can use him to bounce permanents that are ruining your game plan.

<div id="Doomsday" class="tabcontent hidden border border-solid border-stone-600 p-4">
    <h1 class="text-2xl text-purple-400 mb-2"> Doomsday </h1>
    <h2>THE LAST RESORT</h2>
    <br/>
    How does this combo work? When sequenced correctly, Doomsday, Gyruda, and Thassa’s Oracle all work together to win you the game on the spot. All you need is a total of 9 mana (3B, 2U/B, 4C) and for Thassa’s Oracle to be in either your library or your graveyard, and Gyruda to be either in your hand or in the command zone. This combo can also be achieved for less mana if Gyruda is on the battlefield AND you have a way to flicker him.
    <h2>The pile </h2>
    <ul class="px-4 list-disc">
        <li> For BBB, cast Doomsday. Choose 5 cards, with one being Thassa’s Oracle and the rest being whatever you choose.</li>
        <li> Make sure to place Thassa among the top 5 cards, recommended having Thassa either be the 3rd or 4th card from the top of your library, in case someone tries to mill you at the last second. </li>
        <li> Cast Gyruda from your hand/the command zone. Gyruda’s ETB trigger goes on the stack.</li>
        <li> You mill 4 cards and put Thassa’s Oracle onto the battlefield. Thoracle's ETB trigger goes on the stack </li>
        <li> YOU WIN </li>
    </ul>
  <p>
    This is an all in combo. There is no turning back once Doomsday has resolved.

    <h1 class=" text-purple-400"> Other Tips </h1>
    <span>
    Cards like Rest in Peace, Leyline of the Void, and Dauthi Voidwalker seem like they turn off Gyruda's ability of playing cards from your graveyard, but THEY DON’T STOP YOU!
    <br/>
    See replacement effects from rulings/gatherer
    </span>
    <span>
    Biggest weakness is Drannith Magistrate, cards that stop ETBs, and other effects like Grafdigger's Cage
    </span>
    <span>
    Gyruda is very mana rock dependent since our mana ask is so large.
