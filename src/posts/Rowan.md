<h1 class="text-2xl text-teal-400"> GAMEPLAN </h1>

Deal damage to yourself with lands, Ad Nauseum, Plunge Into Darkness, etc and activate your commander to cheat out big spells. 

A magic number is generally 4.

<br/>
<h1 class="text-2xl text-purple-400"> Searing Touch + Birgi, God of Storytelling </h1>

Deal 4 damage to yourself, activate Rowan.

Cast Searing Touch with Birgi on board, buyback cost is reduced by Rowan's ability, a red pip is made with Birgi, thus creating infite damage/storm.

<br/>
<h1 class="text-2xl text-purple-400"> Dualcaster Mage + Saw in Half / Twinflame </h1>


SiH or Twinflame, copy with Dualcaster, go infinite.

Bonus with Lightning bolt. 

<ul class="px-4 list-disc">
    <li>Cast Saw in Half destroying a creature you control. </li>
    <li> HOLD PRIORITY and cast Dualcaster Mage targeting SiH. </li>
    <li> Before the last DCM ability triggers, cast Lightning Bolt</li>
    <li> Now since you will have 2 DCM triggers due to SiH, use one to target SiH, and the other to target Lightning Bolt.</li>
    <li> Nuke your opponents for the win!</li>
</ul>
